matlab codes for honey bee stage model and sensitivity tests 

1.Healthy Colony dynamics folder includes all the matlab codes for simulating a healthy colony dynamics-first run the trialsurf to simulate a range of honey collection accumulated by the active nectar foragers bythe end of each day, parameters values are in the "honeycollection.m", the ode equations are in the "nectarODE.m"

2. Sensitivitytest folder includes all the codes to run the two sensitivity tests (First-global Morris Screening--ttmorris, second-EFAST-ttfast) to evaluate the importance of each parameters, the "comparisionwithactualcolonyweightdata FPE2012.m" is the code to compare the model simulation with the 2012 field data of colony weight
